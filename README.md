# Hybrid-Deep-Convolutional-Generative-Adversarial-Networks

Abstract

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have made significant advances in image synthesis, particularly in generating high-resolution and diverse visuals. However, quantum machine learning (QML) modelsâ€”especially quantum GANsâ€”often face challenges in image quality due to current hardware limitations and dependence on feature compression. In this work, we introduce the Hybrid Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (Hybrid DCGAN), a novel architecture that integrates classical convolutional discriminators with quantum generators built using trainable Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs). By employing amplitude encoding, our model preserves spatial features without requiring dimensionality reduction, leading to efficient training and enhanced image quality. Through simulations on the MNIST, EMNIST, and Fashion MNIST datasets, Hybrid DCGAN demonstrates superior performance compared to existing quantum-based models in both visual fidelity and FrÃ©chet Inception Distance (FID) scores, achieving results comparable to classical DCGANs. These findings underscore the scalability and potential of hybrid quantum-classical models in advanced generative tasks.
